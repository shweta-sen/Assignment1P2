 <p>The plot illustrates daily email activity during the month of May by comparing the number of emails received versus the number of emails sent. The number of emails sent is consistently lower than the number of emails received, however the send/receive volumes do tend to mirror each other across the peaks and valleys. As anticipated, the number of emails sent/received takes a dip on the dates that fall on a weekend or holiday.
