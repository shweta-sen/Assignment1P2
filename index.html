<h1 class="title"><span>Email Activity in May: Emails Received vs. Sent</span></h1>
<p>The plot illustrates daily email activity during the month of May by comparing the number of emails received versus
    the number of emails sent. The number of emails sent is consistently lower than the number of emails received,
    however the send/receive volumes do tend to mirror each other across the peaks and valleys. As anticipated, the
    number of emails sent/received takes a dip on the dates that fall on a weekend or holiday.</p>
<p>Hover over the graph to view the quantity of incoming and outgoing emails during the month of May. Click on the data
    points in red to read about patterns and notable observations.</p>
